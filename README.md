# About Me

Hey there!! I'm Kirin Narine a new graduate from Northeastern University with a degree in Computer Science and Game Developement! I'm a lifelong fan of the medium and believe that not only can it function as a form of escapism, but can also allow for experiences more evocative and immersive than anything other. This site exists to showcase the various game projects that I've worked on as I'm very proud of them and nothing makes me happier than seeing people enjoying the things that I created.
