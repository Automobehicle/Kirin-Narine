# Intro

Hey there!! I'm Kirin Narine a new graduate from Northeastern University with a degree in Computer Science and Game Developement! I've been fan of the medium for as long as I can remember and believe that not only can it function as a form of escapism, but can also allow for experiences more evocative and immersive than anything other. This site exists to showcase the various game projects that I've worked on as I'm very proud of them and nothing makes me happier than seeing people enjoying the things that I created.

## Heart of the Cards
[Itch.io Link](https://jlewis19.itch.io/heart-of-the-cards).

A first person boss rush shooter where the strength of your offense is dictated by your ability to make poker hands. The higher the value of the hand you create the stronger your attacks will be. In the game you are tasked with defeating a series of enemies in order to clear your debt. The enemies that you will face are all themed after different card games which influenced how they behaved and what their attacks are.

While not my idea initially I found the initial pitch to be quite interesting and seemed like a fun idea worth exploring. On this project I was responsible for the implementation of the basic movement functions, implementation and design of various boss attacks, implementation of basic enemies, as well as general polish for the game which included things like animations and general level structure. I was also responsible for gathering footage for and editing together trailer for the game.
